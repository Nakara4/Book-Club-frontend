# Follow/Unfollow UX Polish Features

This document outlines the UX polish features implemented for the follow/unfollow functionality as part of Step 11.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Global Toast Notifications with Retry

- **Location**: `src/features/toast/toastSlice.js` and `src/components/ui/ToastContainer.jsx`
- **Description**: Global toast system for displaying follow/unfollow error messages with retry functionality
- **Features**:
  - Error toasts with retry buttons for failed follow/unfollow actions
  - Success toasts for successful actions
  - Auto-dismiss after configurable duration
  - Support for different toast types (success, error, warning, info)
  - Retry actions can be functions or Redux actions

**Usage**:
```javascript
import { addErrorToast } from '../../toast/toastSlice';

dispatch(addErrorToast({
  message: 'Failed to follow user',
  retryAction: () => handleRetry(),
  retryLabel: 'Try Again'
}));
```

### 2. Screen Reader Announcements

- **Location**: `src/utils/screenReaderAnnounce.js`
- **Description**: Accessibility utility for announcing state changes to screen readers
- **Features**:
  - Invisible aria-live region for announcements
  - Support for assertive and polite announcement priorities
  - Automatic cleanup to prevent announcement buildup
  - Follow/unfollow state changes are announced

**Usage**:
```javascript
import { announce } from '../../../utils/screenReaderAnnounce';

announce('You are now following this user');
```

### 3. Internationalization (i18n)

- **Location**: `src/contexts/i18nContext.jsx`
- **Description**: Complete i18n system with localized button labels and messages
- **Supported Languages**: English, Spanish, French, German
- **Features**:
  - Localized button labels: "Follow", "Following", "Requested"
  - Localized loading states: "Following...", "Unfollowing..."
  - Localized ARIA labels for accessibility
  - Localized toast messages and screen reader announcements
  - Language preference persisted in localStorage

**Supported Translations**:
- Button labels: Follow, Following, Unfollow, Requested
- Loading states
- ARIA labels for accessibility
- Toast error/success messages
- Screen reader announcements

**Usage**:
```javascript
import { useFollowTranslation } from '../../../contexts/i18nContext';

const { followLabel, followingLabel, followedAnnouncement } = useFollowTranslation();
```

### 4. Analytics Events

- **Location**: `src/features/analytics/analyticsSlice.js` (enhanced)
- **Description**: Comprehensive analytics tracking for follow/unfollow actions
- **Events Tracked**:
  - `user_follow`: When a user successfully follows another user
  - `user_unfollow`: When a user successfully unfollows another user
  - `user_follow_error`: When a follow action fails
  - `user_unfollow_error`: When an unfollow action fails

**Event Data Structure**:
```javascript
{
  event_name: 'user_follow',
  event_data: {
    target_user_id: 123,
    action: 'follow',
    source: 'follow_button'
  },
  user_id: 456,
  timestamp: '2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'
}
```

## Enhanced FollowButton Component

The main `FollowButton` component (`src/features/follows/components/FollowButton.jsx`) has been enhanced with all these features:

### Key Improvements:

1. **Error Handling**: Global toasts replace local error tooltips for better UX
2. **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support with localized labels and screen reader announcements
3. **Localization**: All text content is localized and can be changed via language selector
4. **Analytics**: All user interactions are tracked for insights
5. **Retry Functionality**: Failed actions can be retried directly from toast notifications

### Props Added:
- All existing props remain the same for backward compatibility
- The component automatically uses the current language from i18n context
- Analytics tracking is automatic and doesn't require additional props

## Components Created/Modified

### New Components:
1. `src/features/toast/toastSlice.js` - Toast state management
2. `src/components/ui/ToastContainer.jsx` - Toast display component  
3. `src/contexts/i18nContext.jsx` - Internationalization context
4. `src/utils/screenReaderAnnounce.js` - Screen reader utilities
5. `src/components/ui/LanguageSelector.jsx` - Language selection component

### Modified Components:
1. `src/features/follows/components/FollowButton.jsx` - Enhanced with all UX features
2. `src/features/analytics/analyticsSlice.js` - Added follow/unfollow event tracking
3. `src/app/store.js` - Added toast reducer
4. `src/main.jsx` - Added I18nProvider and ToastContainer

## Setup and Integration

### 1. Redux Store Integration
The toast reducer has been added to the Redux store automatically.

### 2. Provider Setup
The app is wrapped with `I18nProvider` and includes `ToastContainer` in the main entry point.

### 3. Language Switching
Use the `LanguageSelector` component to allow users to change languages:

```jsx
import LanguageSelector from '../components/ui/LanguageSelector';

<LanguageSelector className="ml-4" />
```

### 4. Analytics Configuration
Ensure your backend has an endpoint `/api/analytics/events/` to receive analytics data.

## Accessibility Features

1. **ARIA Labels**: All interactive elements have proper ARIA labels
2. **Screen Reader Support**: State changes are announced to screen readers
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support maintained
4. **Focus Management**: Focus indicators and proper focus management
5. **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of roles and semantic elements

## Browser Support

- All modern browsers supporting ES6+
- Screen reader support for NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- Mobile accessibility support

## Future Enhancements

1. **Request State**: Ready for future "Requested" state implementation
2. **More Languages**: Easy to add additional language support
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Framework for more detailed analytics tracking
4. **Toast Customization**: Configurable toast positions and animations

## Testing

To test the features:

1. **Toast System**: Simulate network failures to see error toasts with retry
2. **i18n**: Use the LanguageSelector to switch languages
3. **Screen Reader**: Use screen reader software to verify announcements
4. **Analytics**: Check network tab for analytics events being sent

This implementation provides a polished, accessible, and internationalized user experience for the follow/unfollow functionality.
